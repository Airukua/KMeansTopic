# KMeansTopic

Project: Topic Clustering Using KMeans
Overview
This project uses KMeans clustering to group a large collection of text data (Approximately 17 million words) into distinct clusters based on their underlying topics. By analyzing the resulting clusters, we aim to extract insights into the prevalent themes or topics present in the dataset.

Objectives

Cluster Text Data: Utilize the KMeans algorithm to divide text data into meaningful groups.

Topic Analysis: Analyze each cluster to identify the dominant topic.

Scalability: Handle large volumes of text efficiently.

Interpretability: Provide tools or methods to interpret and label the clusters effectively.
