# Project: Topic Clustering Using KMeans

**Overview*

This project uses KMeans clustering to group a large collection of text data (Approximately 17 million words) into distinct clusters based on their underlying topics. By analyzing the resulting clusters, we aim to extract insights into the prevalent themes or topics present in the dataset.

**Objectives**

* Cluster Text Data: Utilize the KMeans algorithm to divide text data into meaningful groups.
* Topic Analysis: Analyze each cluster to identify the dominant topic.
* Scalability: Handle large volumes of text efficiently.
* Interpretability: Provide tools or methods to interpret and label the clusters effectively.

**Key Features**

Mini Batch KMeans: Implementation of Mini Batch K-Means to efficiently handle large collections of data.
Cross Validation: Application of K-Fold Cross Validation to stabilize and validate clustering performance.
Cluster Visualization: Use of Word Cloud visualizations to analyze and interpret cluster topics.
Topic Representation: Combination of top keyword analysis and visualizations to provide a comprehensive representation of each topic.
